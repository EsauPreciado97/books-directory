# Books Directory

The aim of this project is to create a simple directory of books. 

You will be able to:

* Get all books.
* Get a single book by ID.
* Add new books to the collection.
* Edit the data of a single book.
* Delete a book.

There is no need to create a collection in a DataBase, simulating the data inside an array of objs should be fine. 

# The stack
* NodeJS
* NPM
* Express
